This Python code represents a basic simulation of a pizza shop management system. It allows customers to place orders, tracks their orders, cooks the pizzas, and assigns tables based on the number of customers. Let's go through the code step by step to understand its functionality:

1. Class `Oven`:
   - It represents the oven in the pizza shop.
   - The `__init__` method initializes two lists, `ready_pizzas` and `raw_pizza`, to keep track of pizzas ready for serving and pizzas that need to be cooked, respectively.
   - The `get_raw_pizza` method retrieves the first ordered pizza from the database (file `db_order_customers.txt`), deletes it from the database, and adds it to the list `raw_pizza` to indicate that it needs to be cooked.
   - The `cook` method simulates the cooking process by removing a pizza from `raw_pizza`, representing it as a "ready pizza," and returning it.

2. Class `Table`:
   - It represents the tables in the pizza shop.
   - The `__init__` method initializes `capacity` and `free_space` attributes to track the table's maximum capacity and remaining free seats.
   - The `set_capacity` method sets the maximum capacity of the table.
   - The `locate_customers` method takes the number of customers and assigns them to the table if there is enough free space. Otherwise, it informs the user that the table is full.

3. Functions:
   - `order_from_customer`: Allows customers to place orders by choosing the number of customers and the type of pizza (Small or Large) for each customer. The order details are saved to the `db_order_customers.txt` file.
   - `check_order_list`: Displays the list of orders in the database (`db_order_customers.txt`) along with their respective order IDs.
   - `pizza_details`: Shows information about the waiting customers and the pizza types (Small or Large) they ordered.
   - `rem_line`: A helper function that removes blank lines from a list.

4. Main Menu (Program Starts):
   - The program uses a while loop to display a menu and prompt the user for input until they choose to exit (`0`).
   - When the user selects `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`, the corresponding functions (`order_from_customer`, `check_order_list`, `pizza_details`, `Oven.get_raw_pizza` and `Oven.cook`) are called to perform the respective actions.

It's important to note that this code seems to be a simple simulation and may not handle all real-world scenarios, such as error handling, input validation, or concurrent access to the database file. For a real application, additional features and robustness would be required.
